**[üìò Paper (npj Digital Medicine, under revision)](https://github.com/ZheChen1999/FBA_DL)**

Radiolucent foreign body aspiration (FBA) is challenging to diagnose due to its subtle imaging characteristics on CT. We present a deep learning pipeline that integrates 3D airway segmentation with multi-view classification. Our model was validated across three independent hospital datasets and outperformed expert radiologists in key diagnostic metrics.

## üîç Overview

* **Segmentation**: MedpSeg, a high-precision 3D U-Net-based segmentation model.
* **Classification**: ResNet-18 applied to 12-view 2D projections of the airway tree.
* **Validation**: Multi-center datasets from three hospitals in Wuhan, China.
* **Comparison**: Model demonstrated higher recall and F1 score than radiologists.

## üè• Clinical Workflow

1. Initial CXR (to rule out radiopaque FBA)
2. Chest CT if radiolucent FBA suspected
3. AI-assisted segmentation and classification
4. Use model results to prioritize bronchoscopy
